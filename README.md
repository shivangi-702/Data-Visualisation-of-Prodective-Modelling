# Understanding Sentiment Trends Across News Categories Over Time
## Introduction
This project explores how sentiment trends vary across different news categories over time. By leveraging sentiment analysis and visualizations, it aims to answer questions such as:

How do sentiments (positive, negative, and neutral) shift across categories over specific time periods?
What prominent themes emerge in news articles, and how are they associated with sentiment trends?
Key messages include identifying sentiment shifts, uncovering prominent themes, and recognizing potential biases in news reporting.
